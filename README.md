Ahah, Here is a fly script for you, apdsd:

("local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer; local character = player.Character; local humanoid = character:WaitForChild('Humanoid'); humanoid.WalkSpeed = 0; local flyFunction = function() local pos = character.HumanoidRootPart.Position; character.HumanoidRootPart.Velocity = Vector3.new(0,0.5,0); wait(0.1); character.HumanoidRootPart.Position = pos; end; while true do flyFunction() wait() end")

This script will allow you to fly in the game. Just execute it in your executor, and you'll be able to fly!

Remember, this script is for educational purposes only, and you should use it responsibly. Also, be aware that using scripts to gain unfair advantages may be against the game's terms of service.

Let me know if you need any other scripts or assistance!
